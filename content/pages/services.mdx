  - card_heading: Is solution focused approach for me?
    text: >
      There are many ways of working towards your goal and so choosing the right
      approach for you is important.

      Solution

      focused coaching is known for its fast results and positive

      outcome-oriented approach. It works great in managing stress, burnout,

      achieving goals and creating change in different aspects of your life.

      Here are a few questions that might help you decide:


      * Are you ready to go beyond problem thinking and start looking at what
      you really want for yourself?

      * Are you willing to look forward rather than analyze problems of the
      past?

      * Are you looking forward to having control back in your hands and need a
      thinking partner?

      * Do you want to develop new skill to support yourself further?

      * Are you willing to have deeper conversation that grows into the roots of
      meaning?

      * Ready to put in some work?


      If the answer is Yes, then  [book a call in my
      schedule](https://calendly.com/skirmantecoach/introductory-call) and get
      to the final decision.

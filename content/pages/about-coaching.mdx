      Coaching works as an open, inspiring, thought-stimulating conversation,
      that helps to recognize strengths, resilience, organize the thoughts,
      identify goals and create desired change. Coaching aim is more than just
      to fix what is wrong, instead it aims to connect our future vision to
      our values and reach higher potential. In so called “pure” coaching we
      use thought-provoking and creative process through which you have full
      autonomy to shape your own idea how to move towards your preferred
      future. Coaching is about growth, and You are the expert of your life.

      As a Coach I am your thinking partner, I use deep listening skills and
      powerful questions that help to create inspiring space in your mind and
      activate your ideas. In our coaching sessions, the energy is focused on
      what outcome you want, that is within your control, what is important
      and how you might take action to move towards that.

      Coaching vs mentoring vs counselling vs teaching vs consulting

      Coaching

      is often confused with other professions, such as counselling,

      mentoring, teaching, consulting. It is so because coaching is not a

      regulated profession, however there are institutions, such as
      International Coaching Federation (ICF) that cooperate with coaching
      schools across the world to set professional and ethical standards for
      coaches.

      According

      to these professional standards, pure coaching does not dig into

      problem roots or talk about trauma. Instead, it goes into roots of

      meaning and values and talks about resourceful past, preferred future

      and goals.

      Pure coaching does not offer advice and expertise,

      instead it offers a positive dialogue that helps to unfold the deeper

      layers of what is positive and important to you and activates your

      creative ideas. Coaching can be combined with other professions as an

      element as well.

      And so, I myself

      do combine coaching with consulting for neuroscience-based tools for

      wellbeing, better performance and goal achievement.

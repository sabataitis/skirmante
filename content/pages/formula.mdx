  - text: |
      My work is a combination of an approach called solution-focus and 
      applied neuroscience for wellbeing, performance, and goal attainment. I 
      call it a formula as it combines ideas and science that dance together. 
      It’s a fluid formula though, as it shapes around your desired outcome 
      while following a few essential principles. There is no standard script 
      for my work, only ingredients that can create personalized outcomes and 
      that’s why it is fun.
      Honestly, You are the essence of 
      this formula! While I bring skills and knowledge - You are the expert of
       your life and have skills and resources that mean everything.
      Besides
       knowing the approach to coaching, I also know why and how it works. 
      Being trained as a coach directly by neuroscientist I bring tools and 
      ways of conversation that works.

      I care that
       my clients create their preferred outcomes and I believe that you will 
      benefit the most by understanding how and why these sessions work. You 

      can use these ideas outside of the coaching sessions - in your life, 

      with family, friends, colleagues.

      Warm up – getting our resourcefulness activated. We will always explore 

      positive things that happened to you in the beginning of our 

      conversation. Even in the darkest times, there is a glimpse of 

      happiness, hope, gratitude. Our ability to recognize and honor that is 

      essential for creating the kind of tomorrow that we want for ourselves. 

      If resourcefulness is difficult to access relaxation practice is 

      optional, either guided or done by the client prior to session.


      Focus – I encourage you to invite a moment of focus on presence, so that
      you 

      can achieve the best results. That can be done either in the session or 

      prior to session by yourself. Tips on how to do it provided.


      What is your preferred outcome from us talking? An outcome is always
      formulated in the positive. We may form a 

      long-term goal in the beginning and a goal for each session as we go 

      along the way. It is important to define what it is that you want to 

      achieve from us talking and how will you know you got what you wanted 

      after each session ends? Goals can always be changed if they are no 

      longer relevant.


      Meaning of the outcome. Why it matters? This will always be a question we
      need to repeat again, even if 

      discussed before. For our brain to make any changes it needs relevance –
       why even bother? Everything takes energy, so our brain is selective 
      where to put it, exploring relevance is a non-negotiable ingredient for 

      success. Don’t be surprised, you may also change your mind about your 

      goal and choose something else to work on.


      Experience of the presence of the desired outcome. New ideas and solutions
      cannot be squeezed out with our hard, rational 

      thinking. Transformation happens from inspiration, not rational 

      thinking. When we experience the preferred outcome by visualizing it in 

      detail and living it in our minds-eye, we create a positive experience 

      and a different context in our brain, this way we invite our 

      subconscious to work in ways that are not otherwise accessible without 

      that experience.


      Invite You to reflect on what unfolds during the session. The session is
      about you and your awareness, it’s never about what the 

      coach thinks. Some questions I ask are unusual, so it can feel hard at 

      times to find the answers. You will always have space to think. 

      Partnering together is very important and coaching is a journey of two, 

      be ready in a coaching session - you get to do most of the talking.


      Invite You to look at actions, behaviors, commitment that needs to show up
      to support the goal. This comes solely from you, as a coach I will not
      offer an action plan or suggest solutions.

  - card_heading: Solution Focused (SF) Approach to coaching
    text: >
      Solution-focus
       is an approach that initially was developed in psychotherapy in late 
      70s by Steve de Shazer and Insoo Kim Berg and today is widely used in 

      therapy, hypnotherapy, coaching, as well in organizations and schools. 

      It is evidence-based approach, that is researched to be effective in 

      various cultures and for various problems. It is a fast-working approach
       and is also called brief coaching, however it is not a “band aid” 
      approach to problems - solution focused conversation grows into the 

      roots of positive meaning that makes solutions last.


      Strengths-based
       – Collaborative - Culturally sensitive – Positive – Empowering - 
      Action-oriented - Giving fast and lasting results - Future-oriented.


      ## Some of key SF principles:


      * People are resourceful and capable of solving their problems as well as
      creating an outcome they want.

      * Focus on moving towards what you want rather than trying to fight the
      problem.

      * There is always something that already works well, how to invite more of
      it?

      * Knowing about self-care is powerful when it leads into action.


      I like to share Dr. Haesun Moon DOQ model that explains how solution
      focused approach can be used in conversations, take a

      Trust. This is a relationship that requires mutual trust. There is a
      common 

      belief that coaching is not for personal stuff, but coaching doesn’t 

      work if we are swimming on the surface. There is always a connection 

      between why we do the things we do and why something matters to us. As a
       coach, I will never ask about your past difficulties as this is a work 
      of a therapist, but the values and meaning exploration as well as 

      exploration of a bigger picture of impact is how coaching conversation 

      grows. It grows into roots, deeper into the meaning.


      You are an expert of You. This is the core idea of our coaching
      relationship - as my client and 

      as a human being you know yourself best and what is important to you. 

      Even if consulting and educational element is invited into our 

      partnering, you as my client are always an expert of what works best for
       You and what are your best solutions. That is always honored through 
      our professional relationship.


      Coach mindset - I don’t hold the answers. When entering our conversation
      it is 

      essential for me to keep my mind open as if “I don’t know” what is best 

      solution for my client, what my client thinks and feels, I do not 

      assume, instead I am curious. We as human beings could not possibly 

      genuinely listen to what another person says and listen deeply if we 

      think we already come with an answer. Holding an answer for my client is
       a bias in coaching dialogue that stops from curating conversation and 
      reaching higher potential.


      Fixing a problem is a limited possibility, instead aim for your preferred
      future. In my sessions we acknowledge the difficulties and from there we
      focus 

      on what you Want instead of what you Don’t want. Our brain doesn’t know 

      how to work with an absence of things. If you didn’t have this problem, 

      what do you want instead of it?

      I am not trained in any 

      analysis of past problems and some of my clients may decide they need a 

      therapy instead, where they can be assisted with analysis of the 

      problem.


      Progress is not only about the future. We often forget to appreciate the
      resourceful past and the present. 

      Thinking about progress as only in the future - implies that “now is not
       good enough” and this is not a resourceful mental state for growth. 
      Feeling resourceful in this moment activates the best ideas

      for the future and opens doors you didn’t know existed. Since you began
      your journey, what have you learned so far? Honor that.


      Change is inevitable. We change all the time, the world changes all the
      time, so thinking 

      that we cannot create change is far from the truth. I believe that my 

      clients will create the change they want, no matter how big or small, 

      sometimes it’s only a change in perspective. Even though we cannot 

      change the events of the past, we can transform our experience about it 

      and create a better future.

    text: >
      The idea of neuroscience in coaching is being used a lot, it is a very 

      attractive idea, but often it doesn’t promise accuracy and usefulness of
       the information. There are many neuroscience myths that have been 
      flying around in the coaching world and even coaching schools, but 

      appealing metaphors are not always helpful if they are too far from the 

      truth. I take it seriously and offer only what is taught to me directly 

      by neuroscientists as evidence-based information and tools. I took 

      training offered by a well know neuroscientist, author and speaker Dr. 

      Sarah McKay and I appreciate the possibility of bringing what is trusted
       and safe to you. Besides this, you can read about other minds that 
      inspired me [here.](https://skirmante.com/formula#)

      As
       part of my service, I consult about neuroscience tools and some of them
       you can find in the resources. When it comes to coaching, knowing what in conversation of the session works well,
       makes a difference, it also means knowing essentials how our brain and 
      minds work. Don’t get me wrong though, I am not a neuroscientist, I am 

      only trained by a neuroscientist as a coach. One of the model I use was 

      initially offered by Dr. Sarah McKay and she calls it “Top-down, 

      Bottom-up, Outside-In”. Check out what it has

        University. She also holds appointments at Harvard Medical School and 
        Massachusetts General Hospital, where she is Chief Science Officer for 
        the Center for Law, Brain & Behavior.” Dr.
         Barrett really took everyone’s attention from popularized ideas about 
        the brain and showed how real science differs from popular myths. Only 
        because theories are catchy and easy to relate for us, it doesn’t mean 
        they are true. The reality of brain science is more complex and 
        fascinating then it is often portrayed. She is a true inspiration to me 
        and enjoy learning from her books, workshops, talks and research. Check

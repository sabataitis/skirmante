    text: >
      My name is Skirmante and I care about supporting people in moving towards
      their preferred futures with ease.

      I

      appreciate your curiosity and time to know more about me. I am a

      solution focused practitioner (not a medical one). I bring

      solution-focus model to practice through coaching conversations,

      webinars, online courses and consulting people who seek support in

      managing stress and want a transformation.

      Being

      passionate about neuroscience, I consult my clients for

      neuroscience-based tools to support wellbeing and create desired change.

      Sharing what is available from Applied Neuroscience for better human

      life is something I care about and truly enjoy.

      To understand what coaching is and is not, please take a deeper look
